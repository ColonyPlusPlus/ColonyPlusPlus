# ColonyPlusPlus

ColonyPlusPlus is the first mod for [Colony Survival](http://store.steampowered.com/app/366090/Colony_Survival/) to use the C# modding API. We're working closely with the developers of the game to get the modding API fleshed out, while also adding some much needed content to the game.

At the moment, the mod mainly sits as a base framework for other mods, while adding a few food items and recipes. In the future we plan to add over 200 items to the game with recipes, as well as balancing a lot of the game. Check out the [changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColonyPlusPlus/ColonyPlusPlus/master/ColonyPlusPlus/colonyplusplus-changelog.txt) for the latest changes.

At the moment we're still using a few assets from the [Smooth Operator](https://mods.curse.com/texture-packs/minecraft/230576-smooth-operator) Minecraft texture pack! We'll be replacing those as soon as possible!

## How To Install

## How can I make my own mod?

If you want to learn how to mod Colony Survival, you will first need to learn C#. The documentation for the game's modding API is pretty thin right now, but we have made our mod's source code publicly accessible [here](https://github.com/ColonyPlusPlus/ColonyPlusPlus-mod).
