## General Commands

### Player List

To get the player list you can use the `/online` command. This will print the list of currently online players in your chat window.

This requires the `online` permissions node.

## Chunk Commands

### Claiming a chunk

You can claim the current chunk you are in (which will notify players who enter your chunk that it belongs to you) using the `/claimchunk` command. This requires the `chunk.claim` permission node.

This only works on the chunk you are currently stood in.

### Unclaiming a chunk

You can unclaim the current chunk you are in (which will stop notifying players who enter your chunk that it belongs to you) using the `/unclaimchunk` command. This requires the `chunk.claim` permission node.

This only works on the chunk you are currently stood in.
